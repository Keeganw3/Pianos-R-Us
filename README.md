<h1 align="center">Pianos-R-Us</h1>

Website: https://pianos-r-us.herokuapp.com

<p> Pianos-R-Us is a B2C commerce application that aims to sell pianos, keyboards and music books to music lovers and pianists alike. The goal of the website is to provide users with an intuitive, interactive store that they can return to by hearing about discounts through the subscription service or facebook page and by having an account model that saves customer's details.

The site has been created as a retail store that allows products to be filtered out and searched for based on the customers needs.

Users can order one item or multiple items and place them into a cart to be bought at their convenience through the Stripe payment system. They are able to add and remove products from the cart whenever they want and the total cost is displayed at all times. Users can also make an account to save their details, show their order history and give reviews to products.

# Features
## Existing Features
## F1:Navigation Bar
* The navigation bar is provided at the top of the webpage to allow the user to easily explore the website. It also maintains a consistent look across the website. The navbar lets the user find the products they're looking for by providing categories which can be further refined through filtering on the product page. They can also return to the home page through the site logo, and access their cart and account functionalities if they're signed in by clicking on the appropriate icons. If they're not signed in they will be shown links to sign in or register for an account instead. The account icon also changes colour based on whether the user is signed in or not. Lastly, the user can return to the landing page at any time using the site icon in the top left of the navbar.

## Account Registration
### F8:Registration Page
* This application allows the user to create an account to log in and access additional features on the app. When registering the webpage will ask for a username (that doesn't already exist), an optional email, a password, and the password a second time to confirm it. The webpage will detect the strength of the password entered to make sure it isn't too small or easy to figure out.

## SEO and Marketing
### F14:Keywords and descriptions
A range of words were brainstormed and chosen relating to pianos, music stores and music along with words that a user may tangentially use when looking these up. This included short-tail keywords and long-tail phrases to attract large and relevant numbers of potential customers to the website.

The words and phrases chosen were: piano store, piano shop, electronic piano, thomann dp 95, electronic keyboards, 61 key electronic keyboard, wurlitzer electric piano, best electronic keyboard for beginners, bastien piano basics, piano songbook, piano book, piano classics, teach yourself piano, piano books for beginners, piano stool, piano benches.

The relevancy and authoritativeness of these phrases were chosen by manually looking them up on google and seeing their search traffic combined with using wordtracker.com to check the volume of the web searches and competitiveness.

The words and phrases were used for:
* Description and keyword meta tags in html
* Informational alt tags

### Marketing Techniques
The types of marketing used for this app were social media marketing and email marketing. A facebook page was set up to advertise that this website exists.

Facebook Mockup: https://github.com/Keeganw3/Pianos-R-Us/blob/main/pianos_r_us/facebook_mockup/pianos_r_us_facebook_mockup.pdf

The email marketing was set up through Mailchimp which allowed users to subscribe to a newsletter from the website by entering their email address. This was placed in the footer of the website on each page. The subscribers list is maintained on Mailchimp.

### F15: Stripe Payment System
The service was used to give customers a guarenteed safe way to pay for products so they don't have to worry about losing their credit/debit card details or the payment not going through. Stripe works using payment intents to verify the legitimacy of a user's credit/debit card details when making a purchase but doesn't save this information.

### Custom 404 page
A custom 404 page was added to this application so that this page would aethestically fit in better with the rest of the site.

# Future Features to be added
### Staff Page
This page would show the user all of the staff that work on this e-commerce application.

### Edit/Delete Reviews
A user could ask to have their reveiws edited or deleted.

### Toasts
Notifications that would tell the user whenever they add, update or remove items in their cart. They would also tell a user when a purchase has gone through or failed.

## Planning
* A project in Github was used as an Agile Tool for tracking the building process of this project. Issues were tracked using a kanban board and linked to multiple Epics that would show the over all progress of this project's development. Each issue was tested to ensure that they could be considered completed. The criteria of these tests are outlined below.

Wireframes and a data schema were created so that I had a clear vision of the website that I'd want to make.

# Testing
### User Testing
The navbar was tested by clicking each link and icon with each type of user to see if they worked and expanded like intended.

## Manual Testing
### Media Queries
I tested the media queries by manually adjusting the screen size from 576px-1200px to make sure the appropriate changes were taking place at each media query.

At 576px 

At 768px 

At 1000px  

At 1200px 

## Known Bugs
* The text on the confirmation email page is hidden underneath the navbar.

# Deployment
This app was deployed using Heroku.
* Log into Heroku and make an account.
* In your gitpod code create a file called "requirements.txt" and add all of your code's dependencies to it.
* Go back to Heroku and click create new app. This app must have a unique name and a region.
* Now go to the Settings tab and scroll down to the Config Vars section. You will see two inputs called key and value.
* For the first key put CREDS and paste the contents of creds.json into value. 
* For the second key put PORT and "8000" into value.
* Scroll furthur down on this tab to Buildpack. 
* Click 'add Buildpack' and select Python. Do this again and select Node.js. Make sure Python is first and Node.js is second or it could affect your code.
* Go to the Deploy tab and you will see the deployment method, click Github. Enter the name of your repository and you will be given a list of the closest names that resemble what you have typed, click the one you want for this app.
* Sign into heroku on gitpod and deploy from gitpod.
* You should set DEBUG = True when you start making your code to make it appear cleanly in the gitpod repository but when this is no longer needed remove this or set DEBUG to false.
* Back on heroku go to click Open App in the top right of the screen and the app should run as long as DEBUG is false.

## Forking
* Log into Github
* Load up the required repository.
* In the top right of the screen below the profile icon there is a fork button, click this.
* The repository should now be copied onto your Github account.

## Cloning
* Log into Github and choose a repository.
* Click on the green code button.
* You will be given three ways to clone the code. If you're using https, click âClone with httpsâ and copy the link.
* Open the terminal and type in the command "git clone" followed by a space and the copied url.
* The repository will now be cloned onto the computer.
